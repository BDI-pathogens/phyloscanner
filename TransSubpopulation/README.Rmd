# TransSubpopulation

The goal of TransSubpopulation is to infer the proportions of transmissions from transmission pairs resolved by [phyloscanner](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/phyloscanner) while accounting for structured sampling.

The sofeware package comprises

1. R functions to implement MCMC algorithm and infer transmission flows between subpopulations while correcting for sampling differences and visualise the convergence diagnostics.

2. R functions to generate samples from the informative prior distribution of sampling rates under different assumptions.

## Installation

You can install the released version of TransSubpopulation from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("TransSubpopulation")
```

## Example

Tutorials are given in vignettes.
