               interventions to populations that are at high risk of acquiring
               and passing on the virus. Yet it is often unclear who and where
               these 'source' populations are. Here we demonstrate how viral

               networks and to infer the direction of transmission in these
               networks. We are able to deep-sequence virus from a large
               population-based sample of infected individuals in Rakai
               District, Uganda, reconstruct partial transmission networks, and
               infer the direction of transmission within them at an estimated
               error rate of 16.3\% [8.8-28.3\%]. With this error rate,
               deep-sequence phylogenetics cannot be used against individuals in
               legal contexts, but is sufficiently low for population-level
               inferences into the sources of epidemic spread. The technique
               presents new opportunities for characterizing source populations
               and for targeting of HIV-1 prevention interventions in Africa.",

  abstract = "Although the use of phylogenetic trees in epidemiological
              investigations has become commonplace, their epidemiological
              interpretation has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we
              use an HIV-1 within-host coalescent model to probabilistically
              evaluate transmission histories of two epidemiologically linked
              hosts. Previous critique of phylogenetic reconstruction has
              claimed that direction of transmission is difficult to infer, and
              that the existence of unsampled intermediary links or common
              sources can never be excluded. The phylogenetic relationship
              between the HIV populations of epidemiologically linked hosts can
              be classified into six types of trees, based on cladistic
              relationships and whether the reconstruction is consistent with
              the true transmission history or not. We show that the direction
              of transmission and whether unsampled intermediary links or
              common sources existed make very different predictions about
              expected phylogenetic relationships: (i) Direction of
              transmission can often be established when paraphyly exists, (ii)
              intermediary links can be excluded when multiple lineages were
              transmitted, and (iii) when the sampled individuals' HIV
              populations both are monophyletic a common source was likely the
              origin. Inconsistent results, suggesting the wrong transmission
              direction, were generally rare. In addition, the expected tree
              topology also depends on the number of transmitted lineages, the
              sample size, the time of the sample relative to transmission, and
              how fast the diversity increases after infection. Typically, 20
              or more sequences per subject give robust results. We confirm our
              theoretical evaluations with analyses of real transmission
              histories and discuss how our findings should aid in interpreting
              phylogenetic results.",
