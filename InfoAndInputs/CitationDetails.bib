Finding the optimal tree under the popular maximum likelihood (ML) criterion is known to be NP-hard. Thus, highly optimized and scalable codes are needed to analyze constantly growing empirical datasets.We present RAxML-NG, a from-scratch re-implementation of the established greedy tree search algorithm of RAxML/ExaML. RAxML-NG offers improved accuracy, flexibility, speed, scalability, and usability compared with RAxML/ExaML. On taxon-rich datasets, RAxML-NG typically finds higher-scoring trees than IQTree, an increasingly popular recent tool for ML-based phylogenetic inference (although IQ-Tree shows better stability). Finally, RAxML-NG introduces several new features, such as the detection of terraces in tree space and the recently introduced transfer bootstrap support metric.The code is available under GNU GPL at https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng.

Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2\\% and 87.1\\% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7\\% and 47.1\\% of the DNA alignments and 42.2\\% and 100\\% of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3–97.1\\%. IQ-TREE is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree.}",

               infer the direction of transmission within them at an estimated

               deep-sequence phylogenetics cannot be used against individuals in

  abstract = "Although the use of phylogenetic trees in epidemiological
              investigations has become commonplace, their epidemiological
              interpretation has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we
              use an HIV-1 within-host coalescent model to probabilistically
              evaluate transmission histories of two epidemiologically linked
              hosts. Previous critique of phylogenetic reconstruction has
              claimed that direction of transmission is difficult to infer, and
              that the existence of unsampled intermediary links or common
              sources can never be excluded. The phylogenetic relationship
              between the HIV populations of epidemiologically linked hosts can
              be classified into six types of trees, based on cladistic
              relationships and whether the reconstruction is consistent with
              the true transmission history or not. We show that the direction
              of transmission and whether unsampled intermediary links or
              common sources existed make very different predictions about
              expected phylogenetic relationships: (i) Direction of
              transmission can often be established when paraphyly exists, (ii)
              intermediary links can be excluded when multiple lineages were
              transmitted, and (iii) when the sampled individuals' HIV
              populations both are monophyletic a common source was likely the
              origin. Inconsistent results, suggesting the wrong transmission
              direction, were generally rare. In addition, the expected tree
              topology also depends on the number of transmitted lineages, the
              sample size, the time of the sample relative to transmission, and
              how fast the diversity increases after infection. Typically, 20
              or more sequences per subject give robust results. We confirm our
              theoretical evaluations with analyses of real transmission
              histories and discuss how our findings should aid in interpreting
              phylogenetic results.",
