\part{Analysing within- and between-host phylogenies (Matthew)}

Mention that if a file of normalisation constants over the genome is used, the coordinates in that file are assumed to mean the same thing as coordinates in the python's output file names, i.e. coordinates with respect to the same single reference if \c{--pairwise-align-to} was used, otherwise coordinates with respect to the \c{RefsAln.fasta} alignment of all references.
