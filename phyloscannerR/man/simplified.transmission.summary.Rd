\usage{
simplified.transmission.summary(phyloscanner.trees, transmission.summary,
  arrow.threshold, plot = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyloscanner.trees}{A list of class \code{phyloscanner.trees}}

\item{arrow.threshold}{The proportion of trees in which a pair of hosts need to show a direction of transmission for that direction to be indicated as an arrow. If both directions meet this threshold, the arrow is in the direction with the larger proportion of trees.}

\item{plot}{If TRUE, the returned list has an item called \code{simp.diagram}, a \code{ggplot} object plotting the simplified relationship diagram.}

\item{trans.summary}{The output of \code{transmission.summary}; a \code{data.table}.}
